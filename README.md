# iOS-projects
iOS apps made during my internship.
All the screenshots have been uploaded in their respective folders.

1.EmployeeStore

The app uses CoreData of iOS and saves data as objects within the app.
Saving objects is way easy than sqlite, the code is also quite short. 
Using the segue property of table views, the app can edit any existing records

2.Photos

The photos app is a basic example on how to select images via Camera or Gallery
Both the functionalities are implemented, however only the Gallery feature works on emulator.
The emulator cannot access the front cam of mac to take images (try running it on a actual iPhone..it will work :D).
Once you select the image, it saves the selected image in a Photos directory in the App's Sandbox. Also, the Next and Previous buttons help to navigate between the images


3.Scroller

It was my first assignment, to understand how different UI elements work, how to set backgrounds, buttons, views. 
Its a guessing game to move the scroller disc close to the random number generated. The scores and rounds played are updated as you progress.

4.WeatherForecast

The app makes use of weather API and displays Place, Climate by taking longitude and lattitude values from the user. It is an example of JSON parsing and the cases like incorrect JSON , missing lattitude and longitude values and connection problems have been handled.
